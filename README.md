# Pokédex Website

### About This Project:
This is a front end project that was build using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the API 'PokéAPI'. In this project we will simulate one virtual pokédex. To someone that don't know, the pokédex is one kind of smartphone used to pokémon hunters to identify or search for some pokémon in the anime 'Pokémon'.

### My Evolution On This Project:
This was the first front-end project that i build using some API, i never had use some API before and also that, i learn how to make my webpage responsive using the percentuals in my css file, so that way, the code stay more clean and more easy to another person understand. Obviously the method of percentuals inside the css file will not work in some cases, like in cases of menu navigator where change completely when used to mobile or web for example.

### Technologies Used In This Project And Yours Functions:

HTML | CSS | JavaScript | PokéAPI

The HTML was used to build all the elements of the page like the image of pokédex including the input search, buttons | The CSS was used to style every component of the screen | I used the Javascript to give the life of the project, with her we can extend the API 'PokéDex' and from this API we extracted the informations of the pokemons that the user researched | The API was used to extract the datas of the pokémmons researched
