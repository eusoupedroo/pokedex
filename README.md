# Pokédex Website

### About This Project:
This is a front end project that was build using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the API 'PokéAPI'. In this project we will simulate one virtual pokédex, the pokédex is one kind of smartphone used to pokémon hunters to identify or search for some pokémon in the cartoon 'Pokémon'.

### My Evolution On This Project:
This was the my first front-end project using some API, i never had use some API before and also that, i learn how to make my webpage responsive using the percentuals in my css file, so that way, the code stay more clean and more easy to another person understand. Obviously the method of percentuals inside the css file will not work in some cases, like in cases of menu navigator where change completely when used to mobile or web for example.

### Technologies Used In This Project:

HTML | CSS | JavaScript | PokéAPI
